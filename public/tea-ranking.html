<H1>The Best Teas According to Me</H1>
<H2>My top 3 teas of all time.</H2>

<hr />

<h3>Lapsang Souchong</h3>
<p>A very smokey, nearly whiskey-like tea. For the "I need a drink" moments during the day.</p>

<h3>Jasmine Silver Needle</h3>
<p>A flowery, fresh, relaxing tea. Reminds me of having tea with my grandma.</p>

<h3>Hojicha</h3>
<p>A nutty, delicious tea. The equivalent of a liquid snack.</p>
